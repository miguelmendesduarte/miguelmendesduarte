## Hey! Nice to see you üëã
Welcome to my page.

I'm Miguel, Machine Learning Engineer from üáµüáπ **Portugal**.

I enjoy working on projects that solve meaningful problems, particularly in areas like **environmental challenges**, **sports analytics**, and **economic modeling**.

#### Fun Facts:
- I'm a huge fan of the **Green Bay Packers** in the NFL üèà. Sometimes I do crazy things like staying up until 4 AM just to watch them play!
- Recently, I started a **"picture a day" challenge** üì∏ to appreciate the beauty in everyday things that often go unnoticed.
- I can't read just one book at a time üìö - I always have multiple books on my bedside table, each with its own bookmark!
- **Published a paper** üìñ: Developed a new method using satellite imagery to detect plastic waste in the ocean, with my findings now published.

#### Currently Working On:
- **NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Submission**: Evaluating how defensive backs (DBs) disguise their intentions to improve defensive performance.
- **LLM Models**: Developing a self-presenting AI version of myself that tells the world about my work, passions, and pizza preferences (because why not, right?)
- **Micro SaaS Project**: Building a micro SaaS that returns movie scenes based on user-provided descriptions.
